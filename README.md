# RAGnificent

A Chrome extension that uses on-device AI to provide quick, relevant answers about any webpage's content.

## Features

- ü§ñ On-device AI processing for privacy and speed
- üéØ Smart content extraction using Readability
- üîç Advanced BM25 search algorithm for finding relevant context
- üí° Natural language question answering
- ‚ö° Fast and responsive interface
- üé® Dark mode UI with smooth animations

## How It Works

1. The extension extracts the main content from the webpage using ReadabilitySAX
2. Content is split into paragraphs and indexed using BM25 algorithm
3. When you ask a question, the most relevant paragraphs are selected
4. The on-device AI model generates a concise answer based on the selected context

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Content Processing**: 
  - ReadabilitySAX for content extraction
  - TurndownService for HTML to text conversion
  - Custom BM25 implementation for relevance ranking
- **AI**: Uses the Chrome Extension AI API for on-device processing
